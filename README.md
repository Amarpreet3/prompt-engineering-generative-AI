### Introduction

Welcome to the "Prompt Engineering with Generative AI" repository! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates various techniques and strategies for prompt engineering with generative AI models. The primary focus is on utilizing large language models (LLMs) to achieve desired outputs by carefully crafting and refining prompts.

### Repository Contents

- **`prompt-engineering-with-generative-ai.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing code, explanations, and examples to guide you through the process of prompt engineering. The notebook includes sections on zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inference, as well as parameter tuning for optimal results.

### Key Sections in the Notebook

1. **Introduction to Prompt Engineering**
   - Overview of prompt engineering and its significance in generative AI.
   - Explanation of zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inference techniques.

2. **Zero-Shot Inference**
   - Examples and explanations of how to use LLMs without any task-specific examples.
   - Evaluation of model performance with zero-shot prompts.

3. **One-Shot and Few-Shot Inference**
   - Demonstration of one-shot inference with a single example to guide the model.
   - Few-shot inference examples to provide the model with multiple examples for better understanding.
   - Explanation of in-context learning and its impact on model outputs.

4. **Parameter Tuning**
   - Detailed explanation of various parameters such as `max_new_tokens`, `do_sample`, `temperature`, `top_k`, and `top_p`.
   - Examples showcasing how different parameter settings affect the model's output.
   - Tips for choosing the right parameters for your specific use case.

5. **Limitations and Considerations**
   - Discussion on the limitations of prompt engineering.
   - Best practices to avoid common pitfalls.
   - Insights into the balance between prompt length, context, and performance.
